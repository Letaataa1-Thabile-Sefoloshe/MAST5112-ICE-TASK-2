Application Details
Description

The Mystery Number Challenge is a simple number-guessing game built with React Native. The app generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess the number. 
After each guess, feedback is provided to guide the player whether the guess is too high or too low until they find the correct number.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flow of the Game

The game starts by generating a random secret number.

The user enters their guess into the input field.

Upon pressing Submit Guess, the app checks the input and:

Prompts if the guess is not a valid number between 1 and 100.

Gives feedback if the guess is too high or too low.

Displays a Congratulations! message when the correct number is guessed.

The app also tracks the number of guesses made.

The user can click Restart Game at any time to reset the game and start fresh.

Working on this project helped me strengthen my understanding of React Native components, state management (useState), and user input handling. I also learned how to design a simple 
but interactive user interface with feedback that updates dynamically.

This project was a great learning experience in teamwork, debugging, and building an application from scratch. It gave me confidence in creating mobile applications and laid a strong 
foundation for more complex projects in the future.
